OK... you can define classes and associations. You can save them. You would probably like to get them from 
the database again :-) Easy:

<pre><%- koala(".js", partial("code/find-objects/finding-1.ejs")) %></pre>

Since v0.4.3 there is an option for find methods, which forces the load of associated data. The resulting objects
will store the data in the <i>fetchedAssociations</i> attribute:

<pre><%- koala(".js", partial("code/find-objects/finding-2.ejs")) %></pre>
